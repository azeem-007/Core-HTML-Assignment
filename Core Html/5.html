    <h1>Fullstack Web Development Tech Stack</h1>
    <dl>
    <dt>MEAN STACK</dt>
    <dd>MEAN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS (or Angular), and Node.js. It's a popular stack for building dynamic web applications. MongoDB is used for the database, Express.js for the backend framework, Angular for the frontend framework, and Node.js for server-side scripting.</dd>
    <dt>MERN STACK</dt>
    <dd>MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Similar to MEAN, MERN is used for building web applications but replaces Angular with React for the frontend. It's known for its flexibility and robust performance.</dd>
    <dt>LAMP Stack</dt>
    <dd>LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Python/Perl. It's one of the oldest and most widely used web development stacks. Linux is the operating system, Apache is the web server, MySQL is the database, and PHP/Python/Perl are the scripting languages for server-side development.</dd>
    <dt>Django</dt>
    <dd>Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It provides a robust set of tools for building web applications, including an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interaction.</dd>
    <dt>Vue.js Stack</dt>
    <dd>The Vue.js stack revolves around Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It can be combined with various backend technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and databases such as MongoDB or MySQL.</dd>
    <dt>GraphQL Stack</dt>
    <dd>GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. A GraphQL stack typically involves using GraphQL on the frontend (e.g., with React or Vue.js) and a compatible server (e.g., Apollo Server) on the backend to provide a more efficient and flexible API.</dd>
